# Optimization of a Compression-Encryption-Transmission Model Using Software Pipelining
A rebuild of a previous project in C++. This repository shall focus on analysis and performance of the pipeline rather than a full system design built with C++ as shown in the previous project.



# Setup
Ensure that you have Python3 installed. It is recommended that you set up a virtual environment such as *virtualenv* or *conda* first before proceeding. Run the following code to install the necessary modules afterwards:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
